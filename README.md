The react front-end for my simple RESTful API using Node.js, Express & MongoDB https://github.com/jjginga/books-city/

You can check it out working in here: https://books-city.herokuapp.com/
Some features (like the form to edit books or customers, the ability to lend a book) only appear if logged in, you can create a user and login yourself. 
Some like deliting data are only available for admin (I can make your user admin to try them).

Feel free to drop you feedback.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

(you can try running in your pc with "npm install" and "npm start")
